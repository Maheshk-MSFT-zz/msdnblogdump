<div id='content'>All,

There is always an excitement and authentic feel when we read/blog/refer any of the MSDN Tech blogs. I follow quite a bunch of MSDN blogs and always prefer reading over any other non-Microsoft blog post. I start referring first -MSDN documentation and then PG team blog or PM's blog for better clarity.

Blogging is not new to me, Yes -I have an award winning blog at <a href="https://maheshkumar.wordpress.com/">https://maheshkumar.wordpress.com/</a> (awarded by our Steve Ballmer) writing for the past 10+ years in WordPress medium(started originally in Live.spaces.com later moved). Being a blogger, I always love to share the interesting tech stuff/code which I read and tried for better understanding and also valuable feedback from readers. I greatly believe in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">learning by sharing</span></strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">About me:</span> I am a passionate C#.NET developer &amp; technologist started my career in 2004.

Currently I work for Microsoft as Technical Evangelist for Azure assisting ISV's to grow bigger.

I follow Cloud news from the initial stage(early adaptor) and tried various hands-on offerings from Azure and AWS stack. Apart from technical stuff, I spend time with family &amp; friends, market news, travelling, <a href="https://twitter.com/MahesKBlr" title="@MahesKBlr">@MahesKBlr</a> and reading strategy books.
