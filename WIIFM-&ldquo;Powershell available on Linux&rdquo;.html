<div id='content'>When I first read this announcement - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powershell-is-open-sourced-and-is-available-on-linux/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powershell-is-open-sourced-and-is-available-on-linux/</a>, I thought what the heck we are trying to solve when “Bash/Python/Perl” Linux already has got for automation &amp; scripting. But it is proved wrong after this video - <a href="https://youtu.be/2WZwv7TxqZ0">https://youtu.be/2WZwv7TxqZ0</a>

But once again, this is a very cool move from our Powershell team by opening up the source code + extending support to Linux and MacOS. Devops would love this for sure, it comes handy for managing or automating <b><i>Azure resources </i></b>across the OS. They are plans to include most of the modules down the line so that, seamless execution for sure.

Keytakeaway:- If we have any PS script written in Windows say Azure VM creation or management /Dockers/AWS storage/VMware resource management etc then we can reuse the same script in Linux &amp; Macos. There is no difference in the syntax. Just copy paste should work without any difference.

Sweet – “We are partnering with third party companies – Chef, Amazon Web Services, VMware, and Google to name a few - to create a rich, seamless experience across the platforms you know and use.”

<b>Write once, runs any ware philosophy -</b>heterogeneous management toolset.
